# My_Kubernetes_Tutorial
This is a repository used to show beginners in kubernetes simple templates to follow with Amazon EKS. Please know that some of the files such as iam-policy must be created by the user.
The ones provided by me are just templates. So if you use these files with your EKS cluster, you will definitely get an error. If you have any questions, please feel free ro reach me on my linkedin.
